          <p>People tend to hold in their thoughts due to the feeling of not having anyone to talk to. There are so many things that you might want to say but end up not saying because you might feel like nothing will change or you might be scared of the outcome. </p>
          <p>In this enviroment you can let out your thoughts anomonusly for the safety of your privacy. It does not matter who or what you are talking about just say it no one is here to judge. </p>
          <p>{You also have the option to allow others to comment under your thoughts so you can receive feedback that is also sent to you privately.}</p>

           <p>I struggle with anxiety and insecurity. My insecurities caused me to always wear a headbead beacuse I feel like my forehead was too big. It was so bad that I would even keep my headband on while going to water parks to cover how big it was.
           Then one day  when I went to go wash my hair I had a really bad tan. My whole face got tanned while the part where I had my headband didn't. It made me even more insercure mainly because if I ever got over the fact of wearing one I still can't because I have such a bad tan line.
           Anexity on the other hand I am a very shy person when you first meet me and I have always been that way. Yet when I go to unfamilar environments by myself I get really anxious.
           For example, I used to go to a small private Catholic School from Pre-Kindergarden through the Eigth Grade but went I got into high school it was completely different I got accepted to a public school that has thousands
           of students and it caused me to get headaches and it made it hard to relax because my anxiety causes me to stress about the unknown.
           Maybe you guys can relate is there anything you have been insecure about or maybe struggle with anxiety because you are not alone.</p>
